As an expert in English sentence simplification, your goal is to break down complex sentences into clear, logically sequenced statements while preserving their original meaning. Each statement must follow a cause-and-action structure to maintain logical relationships.
Instructions:
1. Analyze the Sentence: Identify key causes, actions, and dependencies.
2. Break Down Actions: Convert the sentence into single-action statements while maintaining logical flow. Each statement should describe one event at a time.
  Example:
      Query:When the rabbit is yellow, the fox that is touched by the rabbit will die.
        Let's think step by step.
          	Rabbit is yellow. (cause)
            Rabbit touches the fox. (cause)
            Fox dies. (action)
      Answer: When the rabbit is yellow and the rabbit touches the fox, the fox dies.
3.  Use Simple Language:
    3.1 Use plain and direct words.
    3.2 Avoid jargon, acronyms, adverbs, and adjectives.
    3.3 Do not add or modify meaning.
4.  Ensure Logical Flow: Maintain a step-by-step sequence without altering intent.
5.  Handle Conditionals Clearly:
    5.1 Rewrite "unless," "if," and other conditional terms explicitly.
    5.2 Keep conditions and actions separate for clarity.
6. Use increase instead of more and decrease instead of less.
7. Follow Proper Output Format:
        Query: [orignial statement]
        Answer: [Answer]

Examples:
Example 1:
Query: When the rabbit is yellow, the fox that is touched by the rabbit will die.
